    ## Description
    ```
    Make a Friend (prototype name Snowman Game), is a program that can be used to create a custom snowman. It is designed to show how small variations can make a large difference in design.

    First, you roll a group of three snowballs. This is done in a way where the user has control over their snowmans proportions, without being able to make them too wacky.
    If the ball is too small or large, you have to start again.

    Next, you select accessories. This is done by simply clicking on them. 

    Finally, the snowman is built in a sequence I am quite proud of. A bizzard is formed and when it clears, the snowman is built.
